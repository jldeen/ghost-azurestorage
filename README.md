# Ghost Storage Azure Adapter

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ghost-storage-azure.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ghost-storage-azure)
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/jessicadeen/ghost-storage-azure/_apis/build/status/jldeen.ghost-azurestorage?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/jessicadeen/ghost-storage-azure/_build/latest?definitionId=9&branchName=master)

This module is based on the original [Ghost Azure Storage Adapter](https://github.com/Niyo/ghost-azurestorage) by [Niyo](https://github.com/Niyo), which allows you to store media files using Azure Storage and Azure Content Delivery Network resources instead of storing images on your local machine or local storage.

This updated module will upload your images to the specified blob storage with the file format `<container-name>/images/image-name.jpg` and does __not__ use the `date` format `<container-name>/images/<year>/month/date-hours-min_image-name.jpg` by default (this setting is now configurable).

The adapter's upload process will automatically set `CacheControl` to 30 days, or more specifically: `public, max-age=2592000` and set the appropriate `contentType` to be equal to the image type (default for Azure Storage is `application/octet-stream` so this adapter will override).

### Features

- Ghost version `2.x` (not tested on previous Ghost versions)
- Latest Azure Storage Client Library [SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node)
- Image upload
- Ability to upload in dated sub-directories (similar to Ghost default Local storage adapter `<container-name>/images/YYYY/MM/dd-hh-mm_image-name.jpg`)
- Ability to upload images into a directory `<container-name>/images/image-name.jpg`
- NEW (9/2019) - Upon upload, you will have your upload image available at your desired container path as well as size options to chose from. You can choose the following widths: 300, 600, 900. 1300 I.E:
	- Original image: without date enabled `/container-name/images/image.png`
	- Original image: with date enabled `/container-name/images/YYYY/MM/dd-hh-mm_image-name.jpg`
	- Original image size format(without date): `/container-name/images/size/300/image.png`
	- Original image size fromat (with date): `/container-name/images/size/300/YYYY/MM/dd-hh-mm_image-name.jpg`

In the above examples you would just change `300` to whichever width you wish to use out of the 4 available, or remove `size/300` entirely to use the original image.

### TO-DO Tasks

- ~~Update CacheControl to optional parameter with configurable settings~~(Completed 9/2019 in 1.1.0-rc)
- ~~Add in contentType based on image extension (Azure Storage defaults to application/octet-stream)~~ (Completed 9/2019 in 1.1.0-rc)
- ~~Update adapter methods to support Ghost's added support of [custom image sizes upon request](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/10184).~~ (Completed in release Candidate 1.1.0-rc which now includes custom image sizes: 300, 600, 900, 1300)
- Add in support for Azure Files (currently only works with blob storage)
- Update documentation/readme to include how to use a Connection String from Azure KeyVault instead.

## Installation

Run the following commands in the directory where Ghost is installed:

#### *nix

* `npm install ghost-storage-azure` (note the absence of `--save`)
* `mkdir -p content/adapters/storage` (make the adapters and storage folders if they do not already exist yet)
* `cp -vR node_modules/ghost-storage-azure content/adapters/storage/ghost-storage-azure` (copy the module into the right location, the name must match)

#### powershell
* `npm install ghost-storage-azure` (note the absence of `--save`)
* `mkdir content/adapters` (make the adapters folder if it doesn't already exist yet)
* `mkdir content/storage/adapters` (make the storage folder if it doesn't already exist)
* `cp -Recurse node_modules/ghost-storage-azure content/adapters/storage/ghost-storage-azure` (copy the module into the right location)

#### alpine docker container
Add the following code snippet to your Dockerfile

```
# Add necessary packages for Sharp to work

RUN apk add --update --no-cache gcc g++ make libc6-compat python python3

RUN apk add vips-dev fftw-dev build-base --update-cache --repository http://dl-3.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community --repository https://alpine.global.ssl.fastly.net/alpine/edge/main

# Install Azure Storage

RUN npm install ghost-storage-azure
RUN cp -vR node_modules/ghost-storage-azure current/core/server/adapters/storage/ghost-storage-azure

```

## Configuration

1. Create new Azure Storage Account.
2. [Optional] Create a new container. This will be created on demand if it does not already exist.
3. Get the connection string to your storage account. You can find this in the preview portal, or from running the below [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest&WT.mc_id=devops-0000-jessde) commands:


* `az login` (login to your azure account)
* `az account list -o table` (list available azure subscriptions)
* `az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"` (set your az cli instance to use the appropriate subscription with the relevant storage account)
* `az storage account show-connection-string --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <storage-account-name>` (outputs a connection string to use, example is below) 
```
	{
		"connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net;AccountName=<storage-account-name>;AccountKey=<storage-account-key>"
	}
```

Add `storage` block to file `config.js` in each environment as below:
```
    "storage": {
      "active": "ghost-storage-azure",
      "ghost-storage-azure": {
	"connectionString": "YourConnectionStringHere",
	"container": "YourOptionalContainerName",
	"cdnUrl": "YourCDNEndpointDomain",
	"useHttps" : "true", //Optional: CDN protocol. Defaults to http if omitted. Set to "true", to enable.
	"cacheControl" : "2592000", //Optional: cacheControl override. Defaults to 2592000 (30 days).
	"useDatedFolder" : true //Optional: Defaults to false. Set to `true` to enable.
       }
    },
```

## Environment Variables

You can set your connection string as the Environment Variable `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
